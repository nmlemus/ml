# Machine Learning: my own vision

The main idea of this repository is to be my own place to organize all the knowledge about Machine Learning. There are many books, tutorials, etc. Over there. Sometimes you read something, you create your own code and in two years you don't remember where you put the codes, how to apply this knowledge to solve a problem.

To try to get organized, I created this repository. If you can help others, guide you through the world of Machine Learning, then all the better. So, feel free to comment, ask, criticize -constructively-, everything in this repo you can find.
